# C-Learning-Projects
As I work through K&amp;R I'm going to post my exercise solutions here. This will also include other small C learning projects.


I am also attempting to solve each exercise given the information I "should know". For instance, if I haven't encountered arrays in the book yet, then I won't make use of them on an exercise.


I compile all of my programs with -Wall because I hate myself.
